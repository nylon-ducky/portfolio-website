        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to review my website!
            For starters, my name is Zachary Durso, but you can call me Zach.

            I’ve been studying web dev technologies full time since October of 2020, with a major focus on
            vanilla JavaScript, but recently I’ve expanded into PHP and Bootstrap. I am actively looking for my
            first job in the industry and can’t wait to see what this opportunity could hold. I’m very passionate
            about what I do, and super excited to learn new technologies. In particular I can’t wait to see what
            PHP can help me achieve for the time being.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far I have built some JavaScript based games, many variations of a weather app, a calculator, and plenty of static
            web pages. The code for which can be found on my GitHub and CodePen. I study every day and try
            to actually write code every day as well, most of which can be seen on my github. However, I feel as though
            the best way to learn is on the job. That way I can focus on what’s relevant to the position or
            project and have access to the wealth of knowledge my coworkers would have to offer.
            Nothing can replace the wisdom of someone who’s well seasoned in their field of expertise.

            Outside of work, I am a real person, with hobbies, pets, and a life! I have two lovely guinea pigs,
            named Shmoopie and Doopie, and although they are adorable, I don’t use social media, so you can’t
            find pictures of them there. Sorry!
        </p>

        <p>
            In terms of hobbies, I love nail art and automotive work. Recently in the realm of nail art, I’ve broken
            into the world of gel products, and it’s amazing! I’m most enthusiastic about all things that sparkle, but once in a while I do wear an understated nail design. I also really enjoy automotive
            work, especially when it’s something old or based on Ford’s panther platform. I drive a Lincoln
            Town Car, and it’s my baby. Cooking is another passion of mine. My best dish is pulled pork, but I am particularly proud of my fresh (french) bread. Most importantly
            though, I love spending time with my other half, Michael. He’s the best thing that's ever happened to
            me, but I’m hoping this career change will come in second!
        </p>

            If you've made it this far, I would like to encourage you to check out my resume and the rest of the site.
